      Would you like to scaffold the memory-bank directory?

      I will create:
      - memory-bank/projectbrief.md
      - memory-bank/techContext.md
      - memory-bank/systemPatterns.md
      - memory-bank/activeContext.md
      - memory-bank/progress.md

      These provide persistent memory and AI-readable context.
examples:
  - input: "Starting a new AI project"
    output: "Prompt to scaffold memory-bank structure"
