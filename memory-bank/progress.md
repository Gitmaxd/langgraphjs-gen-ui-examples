- [x] **Agent UI Integration**: Implementation of generative UI components (2024-Q1)
- [x] **Multiple Agent Types**: Addition of various specialized agents (2024-Q2)
- [x] **Tool Integration**: Support for various tool types and external APIs (2024-Q2)
- [ ] **Advanced Interactions**: Complex multi-step workflows with state persistence (2024-Q3)
- [ ] **Comprehensive Tests**: Complete test coverage for all agents and UI components (2024-Q3)

## Version History
- **v0.1.0** (2024-02): Initial implementation with basic agent capabilities
- **v0.2.0** (2024-03): Added stockbroker and trip planner agents
- **v0.3.0** (2024-04): Integrated generative UI components and Agent Chat UI compatibility
- **v0.4.0** (2024-05): Added writer agent and search agent capabilities

## Key Achievements
- Successfully demonstrated the integration of LangGraph.js with rich UI components
- Implemented a variety of agent types showing different generative UI capabilities
- Created a flexible framework for adding new agent types and UI components
- Established patterns for agent-to-UI communication and state management
- Built support for multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Google GenAI, Anthropic)

## Lessons Learned
- Agent routing logic benefits from specialized models like Gemini 2.0 Flash
- UI component complexity must be balanced with the simplicity of agent interactions
- State management between agents and UI components requires careful design
- Error handling is critical for API-dependent operations
- Testing agent flows requires mocking LLM responses for deterministic results

## Technical Debt
- **Test Coverage** (High): Many components lack comprehensive tests
- **Error Handling** (Medium): Some edge cases aren't properly handled
- **Documentation** (Medium): More detailed documentation needed for custom implementations
- **Model Fallbacks** (Low): Need better fallback mechanisms when primary models fail
- **UI Accessibility** (Low): Ensure all generative UI components meet accessibility standards
