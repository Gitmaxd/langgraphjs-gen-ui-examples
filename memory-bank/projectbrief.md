# Project Brief

## Project Overview
LangGraph.js Generative UI Examples is a collection of agent implementations designed to demonstrate how to build interactive, generative UI components with LangGraph.js. The project serves as a reference implementation for developers looking to create their own agent-based applications with rich, dynamic user interfaces that go beyond simple text responses.

## Goals
- Showcase practical implementations of LangGraph.js agents with generative UI components
- Demonstrate various agent implementations (Supervisor, Stockbroker, Trip Planner, etc.)
- Provide developers with patterns for building complex, multi-agent systems
- Illustrate best practices for agent-UI integration in modern React applications
- Enable rapid prototyping of generative UI applications with LangGraph.js

## Target Audience
- AI application developers looking to build generative UI experiences
- Web developers interested in implementing LLM-powered applications
- Teams integrating LangChain or LangGraph.js into their products
- Developers exploring agent-based architectures with UI components
- Engineers building tools with LLM-based workflows

## Stakeholders
- LangChain AI team - Maintaining the core libraries and examples
- Agent Chat UI users - Consuming the agent implementations
- Developer community - Building on and extending the examples
- End users - Interacting with the generated UIs and agent capabilities

## Success Criteria
- All agent examples function as expected with clear, understandable UIs
- Documentation provides sufficient guidance for developers to build their own agents
- Examples demonstrate the full range of generative UI capabilities
- Project serves as a valuable learning resource for LangGraph.js adoption
- Code is maintainable, well-organized, and follows best practices

## Timeline
- Initial release: Supervisor agent with basic tool examples
- Subsequent releases: Additional agent types and UI components
- Ongoing: Maintenance and updates to match LangGraph.js API changes
- Future: Expansion with new agent patterns and UI capabilities

## Resources
- Core technologies: React, TypeScript, LangGraph.js, Tailwind CSS
- Model providers: OpenAI, Google GenAI, Anthropic (optional)
- External APIs: Financial Datasets (for Stockbroker agent)
- Tools: LangSmith (optional, for tracing and observability)
- Documentation: README, inline comments, and code examples
