# Active Context

## Current Development Focus
LangGraph.js Generative UI Examples is currently focused on demonstrating the integration between language model agents and interactive UI components. The project serves as a demonstration of how to build complex agent-based systems with rich user interfaces using LangGraph.js.

## In-Progress Features
- **Search Agent Integration**: Implementing a search agent that can fetch real-time information from the web and present results in a structured UI
- **Agent Chat UI Compatibility**: Ensuring all agent examples work seamlessly with the Agent Chat UI
- **Error Handling Improvements**: Enhancing error handling for API failures and unexpected LLM responses
- **Documentation Enhancements**: Adding more comprehensive documentation for developers building their own agents

## Current Challenges
- **Model Consistency**: Ensuring consistent responses from different LLM providers (OpenAI vs. Google Gemini)
- **Interactive UI Complexity**: Balancing the complexity of UI components with agent simplicity
- **Streaming Performance**: Optimizing UI rendering during streaming responses
- **Tool Invocation Logic**: Improving the agent's ability to select the right tools and UI components

## Recent Decisions
- Adopted a Supervisor pattern for agent routing to simplify the addition of new specialized agents
- Standardized on React 19 for UI components to leverage latest React features
- Implemented a consistent pattern for agent state management using Zod schemas
- Added support for Google GenAI to provide alternatives to OpenAI models

## Immediate Next Steps
- Complete the search agent implementation with rich results UI
- Add documentation on creating custom agent UIs
- Implement unit tests for critical agent flows
- Add examples of more complex multi-step workflows
- Enhance the writer agent with more formatting options

## Active Experiments
- **Stateful Tool Calls**: Exploring persistent tool state across agent conversation turns
- **UI State Synchronization**: Testing mechanisms to keep UI state synchronized with agent state
- **Interrupt Patterns**: Experimenting with different interrupt patterns for human-in-the-loop workflows

## Notes for AI Assistants
- When suggesting modifications, focus on maintaining compatibility with the Agent Chat UI
- Consider that all agent UIs must be compatible with the UI component registry pattern
- Agent implementations should follow the existing state graph patterns
- Pay attention to the separation between UI components and agent logic
- Bear in mind that LangGraph.js's API is still evolving and may change
