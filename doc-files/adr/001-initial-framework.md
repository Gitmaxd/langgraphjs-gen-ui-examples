# Architecture Decision Record: Initial Framework Setup

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Setting up a new project requires consistent standards and structure for AI-assisted development. Without established patterns and conventions, developers and AI assistants may make inconsistent decisions leading to maintenance challenges and reduced productivity.

## Decision
Implement the AI Project Starter framework with rules system, memory bank structure, and architecture decision records. This will provide a comprehensive scaffold for AI-assisted development workflows.

## Consequences
### Positive
- Improved guidance for AI assistants through structured rules and memory
- Standardized development practices across the project
- Persistent knowledge sharing across development sessions
- Better documentation through ADRs and memory bank files
- Reduced ramp-up time for new developers

### Negative
- Initial overhead to configure and maintain the framework
- Learning curve for teams not familiar with the approach
- Need to keep memory bank files updated for maximum benefit

## Alternatives Considered
- Manual documentation approach: Less structured, difficult to maintain
- Various other scaffolding tools: Lacked specific AI-assistance capabilities
- Custom in-house solutions: Would require significant development time
